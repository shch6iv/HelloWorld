While password authentication can be made secure with complex passwords, changing the SSH port, and disabling the root user.
It is best to make use of SSH keys for accessing your VM. 
You use these to protect your cloud server against brute force password attacks by using a public-private SSH key pair. 

become root
# ssh-keygen
This will prompt you to set a location for the keys. The default location is the ~/.ssh directory, and the default filenames would be id_rsa for the private, and id_rsa.pub for the public.
Pressing ENTER 
you’ll be prompted to enter a passphrase

# cat ~.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the entire output to you clipboard and SSH into the server you wish to install the public key on.
you may need to create the ~/.ssh directory if one is not already present. You can do so by running the following command:

# mkdir -p ~/.ssh

 Now you’ll need to create the file to place the output of the public key you copied. 
# vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

 Finally, you’ll need to modify the permissions on the ~/.ssh and the authorized_keys files with the following commands:
# chmod 700 ~/.ssh
# chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Once this is done, test that you’re able to log into your VM without being prompted for a password. If access without a password is granted, your SSH Key setup was successful. You can now modify your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and change PasswordAuthentication yes to PasswordAuthentication no.
